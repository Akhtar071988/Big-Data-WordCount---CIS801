The full background to this event and to the person of Harry Potter is only revealed gradually through the series. After the introductory chapter, the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, and it is at this point that his magical background begins to be revealed.Harry's first contact with the wizarding world is through a half-giant,  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" \o "Rubeus Hagrid" Rubeus Hagrid, keeper of grounds and keys at Hogwarts.

Harry survived with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack, and Voldemort disappeared afterwards. As its inadvertent saviour from Voldemort's reign of terror, Harry has become a living legend in the wizarding world. However, at the orders of the venerable and well-known wizard  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" \o "Albus Dumbledore" Albus Dumbledore, the orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggle" \o "Muggle" Muggle relatives, the Dursleys, who had him safe but hid his true heritage from him in hopes that he would grow up "normal". HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter" \l "cite_note-hp-stories-15" [15]With Hagrid's help, Harry prepares for and undertakes his first year of study at Hogwarts. As Harry begins to explore the magical world, the reader is introduced to many of the primary locations used throughout the series. Harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends:  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Weasley" \o "Ron Weasley" Ron Weasley, a fun-loving member of an ancient, large, happy, but poor wizarding family, and  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger" \o "Hermione Granger" Hermione Granger, a gifted and very hardworking witch of non-magical parentage. HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter" \l "cite_note-hp-stories-15" [15] HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter" \l "cite_note-16" [16] Harry also encounters the school's potions master, HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severus_Snape" \o "Severus Snape" Severus Snape, who displays a deep and abiding dislike for him, and the  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" \o "Defence Against the Dark Arts" Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" \o "Quirinus Quirrell" Quirinus Quirrell, who later turns out to be controlled by Lord Voldemort. The plot concludes with Harry's second confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who in his quest for immortality, yearns to gain the power of the  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorcerer%27s_Stone" \o "Sorcerer's Stone" Philosopher's Stone, a substance that bestow everlasting life. HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter" \l "cite_note-hp-stories-15" [15]The series continues with  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets" \o "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets describing Harry's second year at Hogwarts. He and his friends investigate a 50-year-old mystery that appears tied to recent sinister events at the school. Ron's younger sister,  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginny_Weasley" \o "Ginny Weasley" Ginny Weasley, enrols in her first year at Hogwarts, and finds an old notebook which turns out to be Voldemort's diary from his school days. Ginny becomes possessed by Voldemort through the diary and unconsciously opens the "Chamber of Secrets," unleashing an ancient monster which begins attacking students at Hogwarts. The novel delves into the history of Hogwarts and a legend revolving around the Chamber that soon frightened everyone in the school. The book also introduces a new  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" \o "Defence Against the Dark Arts" Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher,  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart" \o "Gilderoy Lockhart" Gilderoy Lockhart, a highly cheerful, self-conceited know-it-all who later turns out to be a fraud. For the first time, Harry realises that racial prejudice exists in the wizarding world even before, and he learns that Voldemort's reign of terror was often directed at wizards who were descended from Muggles. Harry also learns that his ability to speak  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parseltongue" \o "Parseltongue" Parseltongue, the language of snakes, is rare and often associated with the  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_magic" \o "Black magic" Dark Arts. The novel ends after Harry saves Ginny's life by destroying a  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilisk_(Harry_Potter)" \o "Basilisk (Harry Potter)" basilisk and the enchanted diary which has been the source of the problems.The third novel,  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" \o "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, follows Harry in his third year of magical education. It is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort. Instead, Harry must deal with the knowledge that he has been targeted by  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_Black" \o "Sirius Black" Sirius Black, an escaped mass murderer believed to have assisted in the deaths of Harry's parents. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementors" \o "Dementors" dementors—dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul—which are ostensibly protecting the school, he reaches out to  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remus_Lupin" \o "Remus Lupin" Remus Lupin, a  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" \o "Defence Against the Dark Arts" Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who is eventually revealed to be a  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf" \o "Werewolf" werewolf.

The point at which the mystery is unravelled marks the series' shift from foreboding and uncertainty into open conflict. Voldemort's plan to have Crouch use the tournament to bring Harry to Voldemort succeeds. Although Harry manages to escape, HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" \o "Cedric Diggory" Cedric Diggory, the other Hogwarts champion in the tournament, is killed by Peter Pettigrew and Voldemort re-enters the wizarding world with a physical body.In the fifth book,  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix" \o "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry must confront the newly resurfaced Voldemort.

Despite Harry's description of Voldemort's recent activities, the  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic" \o "Ministry of Magic" Ministry of Magic and many others in the magical world refuse to believe that Voldemort has returned. HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter" \l "cite_note-hp-phoenix-plot-19" [19] In an attempt to counter and eventually discredit Dumbledore, who along with Harry is the most prominent voice in the wizarding world attempting to warn of Voldemort's return, the Ministry appoints  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" \o "Dolores Umbridge" Dolores Umbridge as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts and the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She transforms the school into a dictatorial regime and refuses to allow the students to learn ways to defend themselves against dark magic. HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter" \l "cite_note-hp-phoenix-plot-19" [19]With Ron and Hermione's suggestion, Harry reluctantly forms " HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" \o "Dumbledore's Army" Dumbledore's Army," a secret study group aimed to teach his classmates the higher-level skills of Defence Against the Dark Arts that he has learned from his previous encounters with Dark wizards. An important prophecy concerning Harry and Lord Voldemort is revealed, HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter" \l "cite_note-Ivory_Tower_1-20" [20] and Harry discovers that he and Voldemort have a painful connection, allowing Harry to view some of Voldemort's actions telepathically. In the novel's climax, Harry and his friends face off against Voldemort's  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Eaters" \o "Death Eaters" Death Eaters at the  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic" \o "Ministry of Magic" Ministry of Magic. Although the timely arrival of members of the Order of the Phoenix saves the children's lives,  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_Black" \o "Sirius Black" Sirius Black is killed in the conflict.In the sixth book,  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" \o "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Voldemort begins waging open warfare. Harry and his friends are relatively protected from that danger at Hogwarts. They are subject to all the difficulties of adolescence—Harry eventually begins dating Ginny, Ron establishes a strong infatuation with fellow Hogwarts student  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_Brown" \o "Lavender Brown" Lavender Brown, and Hermione starts recognizing her loving feelings for Ron. Near the beginning of the novel, Harry is given an old potions textbook filled with many annotations and recommendations signed by a mysterious writer, named "the Half-Blood Prince." This book is a source of scholastic success and great recognition from their new potions master,  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" \o "Horace Slughorn" Horace Slughorn, but because of the potency of the spells that are written in it, becomes a source of concern. Harry takes private lessons with Dumbledore, who shows him various memories concerning the early life of Voldemort in a device called the  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensieve" \o "Pensieve" Pensieve. These reveal that Voldemort, to preserve his life, has split his soul into pieces, creating a series of HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horcrux" \o "Horcrux" horcruxes, evil enchanted items hidden in various locations, one of which was the diary destroyed in the second book. HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter" \l "cite_note-harry-potter-prince-21" [21] Harry's snobbish adversary, Draco Malfoy, attempts to attack Dumbledore, and the book culminates in the killing of Dumbledore by  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Snape" \o "Professor Snape" Professor Snape, the titular Half-Blood Prince. HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" \o "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the last book in the series, begins directly after the events of the sixth book. Lord Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gains control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of school so that they can find and destroy Voldemort's remaining horcruxes. To ensure their own safety as well as that of their family and friends, they are forced to isolate themselves. As they search for the horcruxes, the trio learns details about Dumbledore's past, as well as Snape's true motives—he had worked on Dumbledore's behalf since the murder of Harry's mother.The book culminates in the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry, Ron and Hermione, in conjunction with members of the Order of the Phoenix and many of the teachers and students, defend Hogwarts from Voldemort, his Death Eaters, and various dangerous  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_creatures_(Harry_Potter)" \o "Magical creatures (Harry Potter)" magical creatures. Several major characters are killed in the first wave of the battle, including  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remus_Lupin" \o "Remus Lupin" Remus Lupinand  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Weasley" \o "Fred Weasley" Fred Weasley. After learning that he himself is a horcrux, Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest, who casts a killing curse at him. However, the defenders of Hogwarts do not surrender after learning this, but continue to fight on. Having managed to return from the dead, Harry finally faces Voldemort, whose horcruxes have all been destroyed. In the subsequent battle, Voldemort's killing curse rebounds off of Harry's spell and kills Voldemort, disintegrating his physical presence.An epilogue describes the lives of the surviving characters and the effects of Voldemort's death on the wizarding world.Supplementary worksSee also:  HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling" \l "Philanthropy" \o "J.
